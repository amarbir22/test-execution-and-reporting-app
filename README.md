# test-execution-and-reporting-app
TEAR is a MERN application for Test Execution and Reporting. Initially the goal is to archive JMeter performance 
reports and provide insights into performance metrics and compare reports. Future releases will have features to
execute tests from a central QA Dashboard

## Run Containerized app
TBD
### Run 
TBD
## Install
```sh
npm install
```
## Start App and Server

```sh
MONGO_DEV_PASSWORD=ASK_AMAR_FOR_PASSWORD npm start
```
Due to the dependency on the DB now the app requires a mongoDB instance URI. Plan is to mock the DB for running the app in DEV mode.
